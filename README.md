# The Dark Tower

The intent of this repo is for me to go through the internet and do interview programming questions.  Why?  I dislike them.

! I do not intend for this work to be definitive or perfect.  It is work of extra time that I am just committing to when I get time to work a problem.

## I will not be accepting PR's
This is public for others to see and use as a reference.

What you can do is post interview questions as issues to the repo or just issues with my code and I look again at what I did.

### How this works
I will have general cases, and I think I will do multiple tests that cover wider sets because interviewers like to change the test during an interview.

### Side Comments/Notes
- [16/12/2021] Wouldn't it be great to also have the code coverage reports? ie Sonar
- [16/12/2021] Haven't tried it from scratch but getting a build system for PR's and add a coverage gate?
  - overkill on a stupid code project but hell why not
