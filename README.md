# The Dark Tower

The intent of this repo is for me to go through the internet and do interview programming questions.  Why?  I dislike them.

! I do not intend for this work to be definative or perfect.  It is work of extra time that I am just committing to when I get time to work a problem.

## I will not be accepting PR's
This is public for others to see and use as a reference.

What you can do is post interview questions as issues to the repo or just issues with my code and I look again at what I did.

### How this works
I will have general cases and I think I will do multiple tests that cover wider sets because interviewers like to change the test during an interview.
