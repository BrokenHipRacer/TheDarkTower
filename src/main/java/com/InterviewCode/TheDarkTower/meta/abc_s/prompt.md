Given three integers A, B, and C, determine their sum.

Your task is to implement the function getSum(A, B, C) which returns the sum A+B+C.

---

**Constraints**

1 ≤ A, B, C ≤ 100

1 ≤ A,B,C ≤ 100

---

Sample test case #1
A = 1
B = 2
C = 3
Expected Return Value = 6

---

Sample test case #2
A = 100
B = 100
C = 100
Expected Return Value = 300

---

Sample test case #3
A = 85
B = 16
C = 93
Expected Return Value = 194

---

Sample Explanation
In the first case, A+B+C=1+2+3=6.

class Solution {

public int getSum(int A, int B, int C) {

// Write your code here

return 0;

}
